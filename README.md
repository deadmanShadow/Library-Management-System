# Library Management System

A fully functional and minimalist Library Management System built using **React**, **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**, and **TypeScript**. This app allows users to manage books and borrow records with a clean and responsive interface, without the complexity of authentication or payment systems.

## 🧩 Features

### ✅ Public Routes

### 📘 Book Management

- **Book List Table**: Displays all books with essential details.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, update, and delete book entries.

  - Quantity borrowed cannot exceed available copies.

### 📝 Borrow Management

- Capture borrow quantity and due date.
- Redirects to a summary page upon success.
